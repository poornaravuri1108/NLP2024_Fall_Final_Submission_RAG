What is payment currency terms mentioned in aws service terms?,all-minilm,llama2:latest,"The payment currency terms for AWS services are as follows:

 For payments made by customers located outside of India, the payment currency is USD (United States Dollar).
 For payments made by customers located in India, the payment currency is INR (Indian Rupee), but the fees and charges will be converted into INR based on the conversion rate determined by AWS India at the time of invoice.

According to Section 3.2(b) of the AWS Service Terms, if the applicable AWS Contracting Party is Amazon Web Services India Private Limited (AWS India), the parties agree that the provisions of this section will apply. This means that AWS India may display the applicable fees and charges for the Services on the Site in USD, but will invoice the customer in INR calculated and converted in accordance with the conversion rate determined by AWS India on the date of invoice. The customer will only be liable to pay the INR Equivalent Fees indicated in each invoice.

It is important to note that all fees and charges payable under this Agreement will be exclusive of applicable national, state or local indirect taxes (Taxes) that AWS India is legally obligated to charge under applicable law. As per the statutory requirement under GST, the customer will provide all necessary information such as the correct GST registered address, legal name and GSTIN (""GST Information"") in order for AWS India to issue correct GST invoices as per the applicable legal requirements. In the event that the GST invoice is incorrect, the customer will inform AWS India in a timely manner to enable AWS India to correct the GST tax invoice. AWS India will determine the place of supply for the Services based on the GST Information provided by the customer and accordingly charge GST (CGST and SGST/UTGST or IGST) on its invoice. Any withholding taxes that may be applicable to the fees and charges payable to AWS India are for AWS India's account. The customer will pay the fees and charges in full (gross) without applying any withholding taxes. If the customer separately deposits applicable withholding taxes on such fees and charges to the applicable government treasury and issues AWS India a withholding tax certificate evidencing such deposit, following receipt of the withholding tax certificate in original form, AWS India will reimburse the customer an amount equal to the taxes that are evidenced as deposited.",gpt-3.5-turbo,1,"The student's answer is perfectly grounded in the facts provided.
