See the AWS Turkey FAQs for\\xa0more information. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Last Updated: May 17, 2024\\n See What\\'s Changed\\n\\nThis AWS Customer Agreement (this “Agreement”) contains the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Services (as defined below) and is an agreement between the applicable AWS Contracting Party specified in Section 12 below (also referred to as “AWS,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and you or the entity you represent (“you” or “your”). This Agreement takes effect when you click an “I Accept” button or check box presented with these terms or, if earlier, when you use any of the Services (the “Effective Date”). You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 12 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement. \\n\\n 1. AWS Responsibilities\\n\\n1.1 General. You may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement. Service Level Agreements and Service Terms apply to certain Services.\\n1.2 Third-Party Content. Third-Party Content may be used by you at your election. Third-Party Content is governed by this Agreement and, if applicable, separate terms and conditions accompanying such Third-Party Content, which terms and conditions may include separate fees and charges.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n1.3\\xa0AWS Security. Without limiting Section 8 or your obligations under Section 2.2, we will implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help you secure Your Content against accidental or unlawful loss, access or disclosure.\\n1.4 Data Privacy.\\xa0You may specify the AWS regions in which Your Content will be stored. You consent to the storage of Your Content in, and transfer of Your Content into, the AWS regions you select. We will not access or use Your Content except as necessary to maintain or provide the Services, or as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. We will not (a) disclose Your Content to any government or third party or (b) move Your Content from the AWS regions selected by you; except in each case as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. Unless it would violate the law or a binding order of a governmental body, we will give you notice of any legal requirement or order referred to in this Section 1.4. We will only use your Account Information in accordance with the Privacy Notice, and you consent to such usage. The Privacy Notice does not apply to Your Content.\\n1.5 Notice of Changes to the Services. We may change or discontinue any of the Services from time to time. We will provide you at least 12 months’ prior notice before discontinuing a material functionality of a Service that\\xa0we make generally available to customers and that you are using. AWS will not be obligated to provide such notice under this Section 1.5 if the discontinuation is necessary to (a) address an emergency, or risk of harm to the Services or AWS, (b) respond to claims, litigation, or loss of license rights related to third party intellectual property rights, or (c) comply with law,\\xa0but should any of the preceding occur AWS will provide you with as much prior notice as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances.\\n1.6 Notice of Changes to the Service Level Agreements. We may change, discontinue or add Service Level Agreements, provided, however, that we will provide at least 90 days’ advance notice for adverse changes to any Service Level Agreement. \\n\\n 2. Your Responsibilities.\\n\\n2.1\\xa0Your Accounts. You will comply with the terms of this Agreement and all laws, rules and regulations applicable to your use of the Services. To access the Services, you must have an AWS account associated with a valid email address and a valid form of payment. Unless\\xa0explicitly permitted by the Service Terms, you will only create one account per email address. Except to the extent caused by our breach of this Agreement, (a) you are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, regardless of whether the activities are authorized by you or undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors, agents or End Users), and (b) we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to your account. \\n2.2 Your Content. You are responsible for Your Content. You will ensure that Your Content and your and End Users’ use of Your Content or the Services\\xa0will not violate any of the Policies or any applicable law.\\xa0\\n2.3 Your Security and Backup. You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Services and otherwise taking appropriate action to secure, protect and backup your accounts and Your Content in a manner that will provide appropriate security and protection, which might include use of encryption to protect Your Content from unauthorized access and routinely archiving Your Content. \\n2.4 Log-In Credentials and Account Keys. AWS log-in credentials and private keys generated by the Services are for your internal use only and you will not sell, transfer or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.\\n2.5 End Users.\\xa0You will be deemed to have taken any action that you permit, assist or facilitate any person or entity to take related to this Agreement, Your Content or use of the Services.\\xa0You are responsible for End Users’ use of Your Content and the\\xa0Services, and for their compliance with your obligations under\\xa0this Agreement. If you become aware of any violation of your obligations under this Agreement caused by an End User, you will immediately suspend access to Your Content and the\\xa0Services by such End User. We do not provide any support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement with you or an End User obligating us to provide such support or services.\\xa0\\n\\n 3. Fees and Payment.\\n\\n3.1 Service Fees. We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we reasonably suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Services as described on the AWS Site using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the AWS Site, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.\\xa0If we suspend your account under Section 4.1 or terminate your use of the Services pursuant to Section 5.2(b)(ii), we may elect not to bill you for fees and charges after suspension unless your account is reinstated.\\n3.2 Taxes.\\xa0\\n(a) Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive of Indirect Taxes, except where applicable law requires otherwise. We may charge and you will pay applicable Indirect Taxes that we are legally obligated or authorized to collect from you. You will provide such information to us as reasonably required to determine whether we are obligated to collect Indirect Taxes from you. We will not collect, and you will not pay, any Indirect Tax for which you furnish us a properly completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for which we can claim an available exemption from such Indirect Tax. All payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding, as required by law. If any such deduction or withholding (including cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as are reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement.\\xa0\\n(b)\\xa0If the applicable AWS Contracting Party is Amazon Web Services India Private Limited (\"AWS India\") (formerly known as Amazon Internet Services Private Limited), the parties agree that the provisions of this Section 3.2(b) will apply.\\nYou acknowledge that AWS India may display the applicable fees and charges for the Services on the Site in USD (or such other currency as AWS India may deem fit). However, AWS India will invoice you in INR calculated and converted in accordance with the conversion rate determined by us on the date of invoice (\"INR Equivalent Fees\"). You will only be liable to pay the INR Equivalent Fees indicated in each invoice.\\nWe will invoice you from our registered office at the address of your establishment (as registered with the tax authorities, if applicable) receiving the Services in accordance with the applicable indirect tax laws.\\nAll fees and charges payable under this Agreement will be exclusive of applicable national, state or local indirect taxes (\"Taxes\") that AWS India is legally obligated to charge under applicable law. For the purpose of this clause, local indirect taxes include Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), which includes the Central Goods and Services Tax (\"CGST\"), the State Goods and Services Tax (\"SGST\"), the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (\"UGST\"), the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (\"IGST\") as may be applicable. The Taxes charged by AWS India will be stated in the invoice pursuant to applicable laws. AWS India may charge and you will pay any applicable Taxes, which are stated separately on the invoice. As per the statutory requirement under GST, you will provide all necessary information such as the correct GST registered address, legal name and GSTIN (\"GST Information\") in order for AWS India to issue correct GST invoices as per the applicable legal requirements. In the event, the GST invoice is incorrect, you will inform us in a timely manner, to enable AWS India to correct the GST tax invoice. AWS India will determine the place of supply for the Services based on the GST Information provided by you and accordingly, charge GST (CGST and SGST/UTGST or IGST) on its invoice. Any withholding taxes that may be applicable to the fees and charges payable to us are for our account. You will pay the fees and charges in our invoice in full (gross) without applying any withholding taxes. If you separately deposit applicable withholding taxes on such fees and charges to the applicable government treasury and issue us a withholding tax certificate evidencing such deposit, following receipt of the withholding tax certificate in original form, we will reimburse to you an amount equal to the taxes that are evidenced as deposited. \\n\\n 4. Temporary Suspension.\\n\\n4.1 Generally. We may suspend your or any End User’s right to access or use any portion or all of the Services immediately upon notice to you if we\\xa0reasonably determine:\\n(a) your or an End User’s use of the Services (i) poses a security risk to the\\xa0Services or any third party, (ii) could adversely impact our systems, the\\xa0Services or the systems or Content of any other AWS customer, (iii) could subject us, our affiliates, or any third party to liability, or (iv) could be fraudulent;\\n(b) you are, or any End User is, in material breach of this Agreement;\\n(c) you are in breach of your payment obligations under Section 3; or\\n(d) you have ceased to operate in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of your assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding.\\n4.2 Effect of Suspension. If we suspend your right to access or use any portion or all of the Services:\\n(a) you will be responsible for all fees and charges you incur during the period of suspension that we bill to you; and\\n(b) you will not be entitled to any service credits under the Service Level Agreements for any period of suspension.\\xa0\\n\\n 5. Term; Termination.\\n\\n5.1 Term. The term of this Agreement will commence on the Effective Date and will remain in effect until terminated under this Section 5. Any notice of termination of this Agreement by either party to the other must include a Termination Date that complies with the notice periods in Section 5.2.\\n5.2 Termination.\\n(a) Termination for Convenience. You may terminate this Agreement for any reason by providing us notice and closing your account for all Services for which we provide an account closing mechanism. We may terminate this Agreement for any reason by providing you at least 30 days’ advance notice.\\n(b) Termination for Cause.\\n(i) By Either Party. Either party may terminate this Agreement for cause if the other party is in material breach of this Agreement and the material breach remains uncured for a period of 30 days from receipt of notice by the other party. No later than the Termination Date, you will close your account.\\n(ii) By Us. We may also terminate this Agreement immediately upon notice to you:\\n(A) for cause if we have the right to suspend under Section 4\\xa0and the issue giving us the right to suspend either:\\na.\\xa0 is not capable of being remedied; or\\nb.\\xa0\\xa0has not been remedied within 30 days of us suspending your service under Section 4.1;\\n(B) if our relationship with a third-party partner who provides software or other technology we use to provide the Services expires, terminates or requires us to change the way we provide the software or other technology as part of the Services; or\\n(C) in order to comply with the law or requests of governmental entities.\\n5.3 Effect of Termination.\\n(a) Generally. Upon the Termination Date:\\n(i) except as provided in Sections 5.3(a)(iv) and 5.3(b), all your rights under this Agreement immediately terminate;\\n(ii) you remain responsible for all fees and charges you have incurred through the Termination Date and are responsible for any fees and charges you incur during the post-termination period described in Section 5.3(b) that we bill to you;\\n(iii) you will immediately return or, if instructed by us, destroy all AWS Content in your possession; and\\n(iv) Sections 2.1, 3, 5.3, 6 (except Section 6.3), 7, 8, 9, 11 and 12 will continue to apply in accordance with their terms.\\n(b) Post-Termination. Unless we terminate your use of the Services pursuant to Section 5.2(b), during the 30 days following the Termination Date:\\n(i) we will not take action to remove from the AWS systems any of Your Content as a result of the termination; and\\n(ii) we will allow you to retrieve Your Content from the Services only if you have paid all amounts due under this Agreement.\\nFor any use of the Services after the Termination Date, the terms of this Agreement will apply and you will pay the applicable fees at the rates under Section 3.\\n\\n 6. Proprietary Rights.\\n\\n6.1 Your Content. Except as provided in this Section 6, we obtain no rights under this Agreement from you (or your licensors) to Your Content. You consent to our use of Your Content to provide the Services to you and any End Users.\\n6.2 Adequate Rights. You represent and warrant to us that: (a) you or your licensors own all right, title, and interest in and to Your Content and Suggestions; (b) you have all rights in Your Content and Suggestions necessary to grant the rights contemplated by this Agreement; and (c) none of Your Content or End Users’ use of Your Content or the Services will violate the Acceptable Use Policy.\\n6.3\\xa0Intellectual Property License. The Intellectual Property License applies to your use of AWS Content and the Services.\\xa0\\n6.4\\xa0Restrictions. Neither you nor any End User will use the AWS Content or Services in any manner or for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by this Agreement. Neither you nor any End User will, or will attempt to (a) reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Services or AWS Content or apply any other process or procedure to derive the source code of any software included in the Services or AWS Content (except to the extent applicable law doesn’t allow this restriction), (b) access or use the Services or AWS Content in a way intended to avoid incurring fees or exceeding usage limits or quotas, or (c) resell the Services or AWS Content. The AWS Trademark Guidelines apply to your use of the AWS Marks. You will not misrepresent or embellish the relationship between us and you (including by expressing or implying that we support, sponsor, endorse, or contribute to you or your business endeavors). You will not imply any relationship or affiliation between us and you except as expressly permitted by this Agreement.\\n6.5 Suggestions. If you provide any Suggestions to us or our affiliates, we and our affiliates will be entitled to use the Suggestions without restriction. You hereby irrevocably assign to us all right, title, and interest in and to the Suggestions and agree to provide us any assistance we require to document, perfect, and maintain our rights in the Suggestions.\\xa0\\n\\n 7. Indemnification.\\n\\n7.1 General. You will defend, indemnify, and hold harmless us, our affiliates and licensors, and each of their respective employees, officers, directors, and representatives from and against any Losses arising out of or relating to any third-party claim concerning: (a) your or any End Users’ use of the Services (including any activities under your AWS account and use by your employees and personnel); (b) breach of this Agreement or violation of applicable law by you, End Users or Your Content; or (c) a dispute between you and any End User. You will reimburse us for reasonable attorneys’ fees, as well as our employees’ and contractors’ time and materials spent responding to any third party subpoena or other compulsory legal order or process associated with third party claims described in (a) through (c) above at our then-current hourly rates.\\n7.2 Intellectual Property.\\n(a) Subject to the limitations in this Section 7, AWS will defend you and your employees, officers, and directors against any third-party claim alleging that the Services infringe or misappropriate that third party’s intellectual property rights, and will pay the amount of any adverse final judgment or settlement.\\n(b) Subject to the limitations in this Section 7, you will defend AWS, its affiliates, and their respective employees, officers, and directors against any third-party claim alleging that any of Your Content infringes or misappropriates that third party’s intellectual property rights, and will pay the amount of any adverse final judgment or settlement.\\n(c) Neither party will have obligations or liability under this Section 7.2 arising from infringement by combinations of the Services or Your Content, as applicable, with any other product, service, software, data, content or method. In addition, AWS will have no obligations or liability arising from your or any End User’s use of the Services after AWS has notified you to discontinue such use. The remedies provided in this Section 7.2 are the sole and exclusive remedies for any third-party claims of infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property rights by the Services or by Your Content.\\n(d) For any claim covered by Section 7.2(a), AWS will, at its election, either: (i) procure the rights to use that portion of the Services alleged to be infringing; (ii) replace the alleged infringing portion of the Services with a non-infringing alternative; (iii) modify the alleged infringing portion of the Services to make it non-infringing; or (iv) terminate the allegedly infringing portion of the Services or this Agreement.\\n7.3 Process. The obligations under this Section 7 will apply only if the party seeking defense or indemnity: (a) gives the other party prompt written notice of the claim; (b) permits the other party to control the defense and settlement of the claim; and (c) reasonably cooperates with the other party (at the other party’s expense) in the defense and settlement of the claim. In no event will a party agree to any settlement of any claim that involves any commitment, other than the payment of money, without the written consent of the other party.\\xa0\\n\\n 8. Disclaimers.\\n\\nTHE SERVICES AND AWS CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS.” EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, OR TO THE EXTENT ANY STATUTORY RIGHTS APPLY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED, LIMITED OR WAIVED, WE AND OUR AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS (A) MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE REGARDING THE\\xa0SERVICES OR AWS CONTENT OR THE THIRD-PARTY CONTENT, AND (B) DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED OR EXPRESS WARRANTIES (I) OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, (II) ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE, (III) THAT THE SERVICES OR AWS CONTENT OR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, AND (IV) THAT ANY CONTENT WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR ALTERED.\\xa0\\n\\n 9. Limitations of Liability.\\n\\n9.1 Liability Disclaimers. EXCEPT FOR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 7, NEITHER AWS NOR YOU, NOR ANY OF THEIR AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS, WILL HAVE LIABILITY TO THE OTHER UNDER ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LIABILITY, FOR (A) INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, (B) THE VALUE OF YOUR CONTENT, (C) LOSS OF PROFITS, REVENUES, CUSTOMERS, OPPORTUNITIES, OR GOODWILL, OR (D) UNAVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES OR AWS CONTENT (THIS DOES NOT LIMIT ANY SERVICE CREDITS UNDER SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENTS).\\n9.2 Damages Cap. EXCEPT FOR PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER SECTION 7, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OF EITHER AWS OR YOU, AND ANY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES OR LICENSORS, WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU TO AWS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE SERVICES THAT GAVE RISE TO THE LIABILITY DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE LIABILITY AROSE; EXCEPT THAT NOTHING IN THIS SECTION 9 WILL LIMIT YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY AWS FOR YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES PURSUANT TO SECTION 3, OR ANY OTHER PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.\\n\\n 10. Modifications to the Agreement.\\n\\nWe may modify this Agreement (including any Policies) at any time by posting a revised version on the AWS Site or by otherwise notifying you in accordance with Section 11.10. The modified terms will become effective upon posting or, if we notify you by email, as stated in the email message. By continuing to use the Services or AWS Content after the effective date of any modifications to this Agreement, you agree to be bound by the modified terms. It is your responsibility to check the AWS Site regularly for modifications to this Agreement. We last modified this Agreement on the date listed at the\\xa0beginning of this Agreement.\\xa0\\n\\n 11. Miscellaneous.\\n\\n11.1 Assignment. You will not assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of your rights and obligations under this Agreement, without our prior written consent. Any assignment or transfer in violation of this Section 11.1 will be void. We may assign this Agreement without your consent (a) in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or (b) to any affiliate or as part of a corporate reorganization; and effective upon such assignment, the assignee is deemed substituted for AWS as a party to this Agreement and AWS is fully released from all of its obligations and duties to perform under this Agreement. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.\\n11.2 Entire Agreement. This Agreement incorporates the Policies by reference and is the entire agreement between you and us regarding the subject matter of this Agreement. This Agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings, agreements, or communications between you and us, whether written or verbal, regarding the subject matter of this Agreement (but does not supersede prior commitments to purchase Services such as Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances). None of the parties will be bound by any term, condition or other provision that is different from or in addition to the provisions of this Agreement (whether or not it would materially alter this Agreement) including for example, any term, condition or other provision (a) submitted by you in any order, receipt, acceptance, confirmation, correspondence or other document, (b) related to any online registration, response to any Request for Bid, Request for Proposal, Request for Information, or other questionnaire, or (c) related to any invoicing process that you submit or require us to complete. If the terms of this document are inconsistent with the terms contained in any Policy, the terms contained in this document will control, except that the Service Terms will control over this document.\\n11.3 Force Majeure. Except for payment obligations, neither party nor any of their affiliates will be liable for any delay or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement where the delay or failure results from any cause beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, labor disputes or other industrial disturbances, electrical or power outages, utilities or other telecommunications failures, earthquake, storms or other elements of nature, blockages, embargoes, riots, acts or orders of government, acts of terrorism, or war.\\n11.4 Governing Law. The Governing Laws, without reference to conflict of law rules, govern this Agreement and any dispute of any sort that might arise between you and us. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to this Agreement.\\n11.5 Disputes. Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Services, or to any products or services sold or distributed by AWS will be adjudicated in the Governing Courts, and you consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Governing Courts, subject to the additional provisions below.\\n(a)\\xa0If the applicable AWS Contracting Party is Amazon Web Services, Inc., Amazon Web Services Canada, Inc., Amazon Web Services Korea LLC or Amazon Web Services Singapore Private Limited, the parties agree that the provisions of this Section 11.5(a) will apply. Disputes will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that either party may elect to proceed in small claims court if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement, except that if Amazon Web Services Canada, Inc. is the applicable AWS Contracting Party the Ontario Arbitration Act will apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. Before you may begin an arbitration proceeding, you must send a letter notifying us of your intent to pursue arbitration and describing your claim to our registered agent Corporation Service Company, 300 Deschutes Way SW, Suite 304, Tumwater, WA 98501. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its commercial rules, which are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. Payment of filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA commercial fee schedule.

Universal Service Terms (Applicable to All Services)\\n\\nThe Service Terms below govern your use of the Services. Capitalized terms used in these Service Terms but not defined below are defined in the AWS Customer Agreement\\xa0or other agreement with us governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”). For purposes of these Service Terms, “Your Content” includes any “Company Content” and any “Customer Content,” and “AWS Content” includes “Amazon Properties.”\\n\\n\\n1.1. You may not transfer outside the Services any software (including related documentation) you obtain from us or third party licensors in connection with the Services without specific authorization to do so.\\n1.2.\\xa0You must comply with current technical documentation applicable to the Services (including applicable user, admin, and developer guides) posted on the AWS Site at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html (and any successor or related locations designated by us).\\xa0\\n1.3. You will provide information or other materials related to Your Content (including copies of any client-side applications) as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with the Agreement. You will reasonably cooperate with us to identify the source of any problem with the Services that we reasonably believe may be attributable to Your Content or any end user materials that you control.\\n1.4. In connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining licenses and adhering to the license terms of any software you run. If we reasonably believe any of Your Content violates the law, infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party, or otherwise violates a material term of the Agreement (including the Service Terms, or the Acceptable Use Policy) (“Prohibited Content”), we will notify you of the Prohibited Content and may request that such content be removed from the Services or access to it be disabled. If you do not remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content within 2 business days of our notice, we may remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content or suspend the Services to the extent we are not able to remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may remove or disable access to any Prohibited Content without prior notice in connection with illegal content, where the content may disrupt or threaten the Services or in accordance with applicable law or any judicial, regulatory or other governmental order or request. In the event that we remove Your Content without prior notice, we will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law. We terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.\\n1.5. You will ensure that all information you provide to us via the AWS Site (e.g., information provided in connection with your registration for the Services, requests for increased usage limits) is accurate, complete, and not misleading.\\n1.6. From time to time, we may apply upgrades, patches, bug fixes, or other maintenance to the Services and AWS Content (“Maintenance”). We agree to use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice of any scheduled Maintenance (except for emergency Maintenance), and you agree to use reasonable efforts to comply with any Maintenance requirements that we notify you about.\\n1.7. If your Agreement does not include a provision on AWS Confidential Information, and you and AWS do not have an effective non-disclosure agreement in place, then you agree that you will not disclose AWS Confidential Information (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement), except as required by law.\\n1.8. You may perform benchmarks or comparative tests or evaluations (each, a “Benchmark”) of the Services. If you perform or disclose, or direct or permit any third party to perform or disclose, any Benchmark of any of the Services, you (i) will include in any disclosure, and will disclose to us, all information necessary to replicate such Benchmark, and (ii) agree that we may perform and disclose the results of Benchmarks of your products or services, irrespective of any restrictions on Benchmarks in the terms governing your products or services.\\n1.9. Only the applicable AWS Contracting Party (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement) will have obligations with respect to each AWS account, and no other AWS Contracting Party has any obligation with respect to such account. The AWS Contracting Party for an account may change as described in the Agreement, and the new AWS Contracting Party will be responsible for issuing any invoices to you after such change, including monthly invoices. Invoices for each account will reflect the AWS Contracting Party that is responsible for that account during the applicable billing period. You agree to accept invoices from AWS electronically, in a format and method of delivery as determined by AWS, e.g., in a PDF format, as permitted under applicable law.\\nIf, as of the time of a change of the AWS Contracting Party responsible for your account, you have made an up-front payment for any Services under such account, then the AWS Contracting Party you paid such up-front payment to may remain the AWS Contracting Party for the applicable account only with respect to the Services related to such up-front payment.\\n1.10. When you use a Service, you may be able to use or be required to use one or more other Services (each, an “Associated Service”), and when you use an Associated Service, you are subject to the terms and fees that apply to that Associated Service.\\n1.11. If you process the personal data of End Users or other identifiable individuals in your use of a Service, you are responsible for providing legally adequate privacy notices and obtaining necessary consents for the processing of such data. You represent to us that you have provided all necessary privacy notices and obtained all necessary consents. You are responsible for processing such data in accordance with applicable law.\\n1.12. If you have been charged for a Service for a period when that Service was unavailable (as defined in the applicable Service Level Agreement for each Service), you may request a Service credit equal to any charged amounts for such period.\\n1.13. If you are a customer that is subject to the French Politique générale de sécurité des systems d’information de santé (PGSSI-S), you agree that your use of the Services complies with the PGSSI-S.\\n1.14. Data Protection.\\n1.14.1 These Service Terms incorporate the AWS Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”), when you use AWS Services to process Customer Data (as defined in the DPA).\\xa0 \\n1.14.2 These Service Terms incorporate the AWS Supplementary Addendum to the DPA, when you use AWS Services to process Customer Data (as defined in the DPA). \\n1.14.3 These Service Terms incorporate the Standard Contractual Clauses between controllers and processors (“Controller-to-Processor Clauses”) and the Standard Contractual Clauses between processors (“Processor-to-Processor Clauses”) approved by the European Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 (the “SCCs”). The SCCs will only apply when: (i) the GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Customer Data; and (ii) Customer Data is transferred either directly or via onward transfer, to a country outside of the European Economic Area not recognised by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data subject to GDPR (together a “Data Transfer”). When you are a controller (as defined in the GDPR), the Controller-to-Processor Clauses will apply to a Data Transfer. When you are a processor (as defined in the GDPR), the Processor-to-Processor Clauses will apply to a Data Transfer.\\n1.14.4 These Service Terms incorporate the AWS UK GDPR Addendum to the DPA, when the UK GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process UK Customer Data (as defined in the AWS UK GDPR Addendum),\\xa0and the AWS Swiss Addendum to the DPA, when the FDPA applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Swiss Customer Data (as defined in the AWS Swiss Addendum). \\n1.14.5\\xa0These Service Terms incorporate the AWS CCPA Terms (“CCPA Terms”), when the CCPA applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Personal Information (as defined in the CCPA Terms).\\n1.15.\\xa0Following closure of your AWS account, we will delete Your Content in accordance with the technical documentation applicable to the Services.\\n1.16. Your receipt and use of any Promotional Credits is subject to the AWS Promotional Credit Terms & Conditions.\\n1.17. Payment Currency\\n1.17.1 AWS provides a Service that enables payment in certain currencies (“Payment Currency”) other than United States dollars when you purchase certain Services from AWS (the “Currency Service”). When you purchase Services in certain countries outside of the United States, we may require you, because of currency controls or other factors, to use the Currency Service. When using the Currency Service you are not tendering payment in one currency and receiving from us another currency.\\n1.17.2 When you use the Currency Service, Service fees and charges will automatically be invoiced in the Payment Currency. You must pay invoices in the currency specified on each invoice, but, for credit card or debit card purchases, you may only make payments in currencies supported by the issuer of your card. If the issuer of your credit card or debit card does not support the required Payment Currency, you must use a different payment method that does support paying in the Payment Currency.\\n1.17.3 Our fees and charges for your use of the Currency Service, if any, are included in the exchange rate applied to your invoice (the “Applicable Exchange Rate”). Third-parties, such as your bank, credit card issuer, debit card issuer, or card network, may charge you additional fees. The Applicable Exchange Rate is determined at the time your invoice is generated and, for invoices covering usage of Services over a period of time, will apply to all usage and Service charges listed on that invoice.\\n1.17.4 All refunds processed against an invoice will be provided in the currency in which the invoice was generated and reflected as a credit memo or a payment in your Payment Currency.\\n1.17.5 You agree that by using the Currency Service, information related to your payment, including your name and address, may be used by our banking partners to process your payments in jurisdictions other than the United States.\\n1.18.\\xa0By accessing and using AWS Content or the Services, you agree to the terms of the Intellectual Property License.\\n1.19. We will not use Individualized Usage Data or Your Content to compete with your products and services. “Individualized Usage Data” means data about your use of the Services that are specifically identified with your AWS account. \\n1.20. We may use information about how you use and interact with the Services to improve those Services. \\n1.21. Information included in resource identifiers, metadata tags, access controls, rules, usage policies, permissions, and similar items related to the management of AWS resources does not constitute Your Content. AWS recommends that you do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in these items. \\n1.22. Tax Exempt Status\\xa0\\n1.22.1 To request tax exempt status for your AWS account, you must provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate or other equivalent documentation for the relevant jurisdiction.\\xa0 You are responsible for updating such documentation so it is accurate at all times. \\n1.22.2 In certain jurisdictions (as noted in the AWS Tax Help pages), you may only use your tax-exempt account to purchase services that are eligible for tax exemption. If you do not use services for the purpose for which your tax exemption applies, you are responsible for reporting and paying sales and use taxes for that usage directly to the relevant tax authorities to the extent required by law.\\xa0\\n1.22.3 If you are required by law to pay us using your organization’s funds to qualify for your tax exemption, you warrant that purchases on your account will be made with the tax-exempt organization’s funds.\\xa0\\n1.22.4\\xa0We may, in our sole discretion, reject your request for tax exempt status or revoke the tax exempt status of your account at any time.\\n1.22.5 If you turn on tax settings inheritance, you warrant that the application of any tax exemption on your Management Account to your Organization’s Member Accounts (both as defined in the AWS Organizations section below) complies with applicable tax laws. If a governmental authority determines that the correct amount of tax has not been collected on your purchases, you will promptly reimburse AWS for any associated costs.\\n1.23. If you use any artificial intelligence and machine learning Services, features, and functionality (including third-party models) that we provide, you will comply with the AWS Responsible AI Policy.\\n1.24. Certain Services may incorporate generative AI features, powered by Amazon Bedrock, that enable you to use prompts to generate output, including: Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon CodeCatalyst, Amazon Connect Contact Lens, Amazon DataZone, Amazon Lex, Amazon Personalize, Amazon Q, AWS AppFabric, AWS HealthScribe, and AWS App Studio.\\xa0The Amazon Bedrock automated abuse detection mechanisms may apply to such services. See here for more details.\\n1.25. You will not use, and will not facilitate or allow End Users to use, the Services to mine cryptocurrency without our prior written approval.\\n1.26. AWS consents to the assignment of an AWS account from one entity to another, subject to the terms of the AWS Account Assignment Requirements, posted here.\\n1.27. To benefit from any contract with AWS enabling you to use AWS Services under the same terms as your affiliate\\'s Agreement solely because your accounts are joined as Member Accounts of their Organization (as defined in the AWS Organizations section below), your AWS Contracting Party must be a signatory to your affiliate\\'s Agreement.\\n\\n 2. Betas and Previews\\n\\n2.1. This Section describes the additional terms and conditions under which you may (a) access and use certain features, technologies, and services made available to you by AWS that are not yet generally available, including, but not limited to, any products, services, or features labeled “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental”, and any related AWS Content (each, a “Beta Service”) or (b) access and use Services and any related AWS Content available in AWS regions that are not generally available, including, but not limited to, any AWS regions identified by AWS as “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental” (each, a “Beta Region”).\\n2.2. You must comply with all terms related to any Beta Service or Beta Region as posted on the AWS Site or otherwise made available to you. AWS may add or modify terms, including lowering or raising any usage limits, related to access to or use of any Beta Services or Beta Regions at any time. AWS may add, modify, or remove functionality, features, documentation, or other related aspects of any Beta Service or Beta Region at any time and these aspects may be different from any generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region. Service Level Agreements do not apply to Beta Services or Beta Regions.\\n2.3. You may provide AWS with information relating to your access, use, testing, or evaluation of Beta Services or Beta Regions, including observations or information regarding the performance, features, and functionality of Beta Services or Beta Regions (“Test Observations”). AWS will own and may use and evaluate all Test Observations for its own purposes. You will not use any Test Observations except for your internal evaluation purposes of any Beta Service or Beta Region.\\n2.4.\\xa0AWS may suspend or terminate your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region at any time. Your access to and use of each Beta Service and Beta Region will automatically terminate upon the release of a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region or upon notice of termination by AWS. Unless otherwise communicated to You, any Beta Service or Beta Region made available to You is provided for evaluation purposes and should not be used for processing sensitive data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, after suspension or termination of your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region for any reason, (a) you will not have any further right to access or use the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region, and (b) Your Content used in the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region may be deleted or inaccessible and Your Content may not be migrated over to a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region.\\n2.5. Test Observations, Suggestions concerning a Beta Service or Beta Region, and any other information about or involving (including the existence of) any Beta Service or Beta Region are considered AWS Confidential Information.\\n2.6.\\xa0WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMERS IN THE AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE TERMS, BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS ARE NOT READY FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, DEFECTS, OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ACCORDINGLY, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE AGREEMENT OR THESE SERVICES TERMS, AWS IS PROVIDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS TO YOU “AS IS.” AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE REGARDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY THAT THE BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BECOME GENERALLY AVAILABLE, BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING YOUR CONTENT, WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR DAMAGED. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. AWS’S AND ITS AFFILIATES’ AND LICENSORS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAY US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE BETA SERVICES OR BETA REGIONS THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. \\n\\n 3. Amazon CloudFront\\n\\nYou must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront. You are solely responsible for the renewal, security, and proper configuration of any SSL certificates that you provide for use with Amazon CloudFront, including any disclosure of your SSL certificates to third parties. \\n\\n 4. AWS Outposts\\n\\n4.1.\\xa0“AWS Outposts” includes AWS Outposts racks and AWS Outposts servers. \\n4.2. Outposts Equipment. AWS will make equipment available to you to support your use of the AWS Outposts Service (the “Outposts Equipment”). AWS or its affiliates maintain all rights in the Outposts Equipment and is not selling, renting, leasing, or transferring any ownership, intellectual or other rights in the Outposts Equipment to you. You will not, and will not purport to, assign, grant, or transfer the Outposts Equipment or any interest in the Outposts Equipment to any individual or entity, and any such purported assignment, grant or transfer is void. \\n4.3. Facility Assessment. You will ensure that, at all times, the facility at which the Outposts Equipment is located (the “Designated Facility”) meets the minimum requirements necessary to support the installation, maintenance, use, and removal of the Outposts Equipment as described here and otherwise as described\\xa0in the Outposts technical documentation or indicated to you during the ordering and installation process.\\n4.4. Delivery and Use. You will ensure that you have all necessary rights, certifications, and licenses for the delivery, installation, maintenance, use, and removal of the Outposts Equipment at the Designated Facility. You are responsible for any damage to the Outposts Equipment while it is at the Designated Facility, unless caused by AWS. AWS may terminate your use of AWS Outposts and remove the Outposts Equipment if you breach these terms or materially breach the terms of the Agreement with respect to AWS Outposts. In the event that we terminate your use of AWS Outposts and remove the Outposts Equipment in accordance with this Section 4.4, we will provide you with prior notice where practicable under the circumstances. \\xa0\\n4.5. Access to Outposts Equipment. You will give personnel designated by AWS prompt and reasonable access to the Designated Facility as necessary to deliver, install, inspect, maintain, and remove the Outposts Equipment. You will not require AWS personnel to sign, accept, or otherwise agree to any documentation as a condition of accessing the Designated Facility, and you agree that the terms of any such documentation are void even if signed by AWS personnel. You will ensure that no one accesses, moves, or repairs the Outposts Equipment other than (i) personnel designated by AWS, (ii) as permitted in writing by AWS in connection with the maintenance of Outposts Equipment, or (iii) as necessary due to a situation involving imminent injury, damage to property, or an active fire alarm system. You will ensure that no one modifies, alters, reverse engineers, or tampers with the Outposts Equipment. You acknowledge that the Outposts Equipment may be equipped with tamper monitoring.\\n4.6. AWS Support Options. You will remain enrolled in either Enterprise On-Ramp Support or Enterprise Support during the entire period of your use of AWS Outposts.\\n4.7. Services/SLAs/Security. The Service Terms for any Services that run locally on AWS Outposts also apply to your use of those Services on AWS Outposts. There are inherent differences between Services running locally on AWS Outposts from those Services running at AWS operated facilities because the Outposts Equipment is physically located at the Designated Facility where you are responsible for physical security and access controls, as well as all power, networking, and environmental conditions. Due to these differences:\\na. The Service Level Agreements for any Services that run locally on AWS Outposts do not apply to your use of those Services on AWS Outposts.\\nb. Any AWS commitments in the Agreement that depend on AWS’s operation of such physical security and access controls, or power, networking, and environmental conditions, do not apply to AWS Outposts or any Services running locally on AWS Outposts.\\nc.\\xa0The specific compliance and assurance programs for which AWS Outposts are in scope are listed here. For other Services listed here, those Services are not in scope when running locally on AWS Outposts unless AWS Outposts is also separately listed for the specific compliance or assurance program.\\n4.8. AWS Outposts servers \\n4.8.1.\\xa0Installation, Use, and Removal. You are responsible for the installation, use, and removal of the AWS Outposts servers at the Designated Facility and returning the Outposts Equipment to AWS as described in the Outposts technical documentation or as otherwise indicated to you during the ordering process. In addition to other rights and remedies AWS may have under the Agreement, AWS may charge you a lost device fee if the Outposts Equipment is lost between when it is first in your possession and when the carrier accepts the Outposts Equipment for delivery back to AWS. You must notify and obtain AWS’s consent before moving the Outpost Equipment from the Designated Facility. \\n\\n 5. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud\\n\\n5.1. In conjunction with the Services, you may be allowed to use certain software (including related documentation) developed and owned by Microsoft Corporation or its licensors (collectively, the “Microsoft Software”).\\n5.1.1. If you use the Microsoft Software, Microsoft and its licensors require that you agree to these additional terms and conditions:\\n\\nThe Microsoft Software is neither sold nor distributed to you, and you may use it solely in conjunction with the Services.\\nYou may not transfer or use the Microsoft Software outside the Services.\\nYou may not remove, modify, or obscure any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices that are contained in or on the Microsoft Software.\\nYou may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the Microsoft Software, except to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law.\\nMicrosoft disclaims, to the extent permitted by applicable law, all warranties by Microsoft and any liability by Microsoft or its suppliers for any damages, whether direct, indirect, or consequential, arising from the Services.\\nMicrosoft is not responsible for providing any support in connection with the Services. Do not contact Microsoft for support.\\nYou are not granted any right to use the Microsoft Software in any application controlling aircraft or other modes of human mass transportation, nuclear or chemical facilities, life support systems, implantable medical equipment, motor vehicles, weaponry systems, or any similar scenario (collectively, “High Risk Use”). Microsoft and its suppliers disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Use. High Risk Use does not include utilization of the Microsoft Software for administrative purposes, to store configuration data, engineering and/or configuration tools, or other non-control applications, the failure of which would not result in death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage. These non-controlling applications may communicate with the applications that perform the control, but must not be directly or indirectly responsible for the control function.\\nMicrosoft is an intended third-party beneficiary of this Section 5.1.1, with the right to enforce its provisions.\\n\\n5.1.2. For any instance running Microsoft Software (each, a “Microsoft Instance”), you may not use nesting, container, or similar technologies to sell or resell multiple instances, portions of an instance, or containers running within the Microsoft Instance, unless (a) you are the ultimate end user of the Microsoft Instance, (b) you have supplemented the Microsoft Instance with your own applications, or (c) you have added primary and significant functionality to the Microsoft Instance.\\n5.2. In conjunction with the Services, you may be allowed to use certain software (including related support, maintenance, and documentation) developed, owned, or provided by third parties or their licensors. Use of third party software is subject to these additional terms and conditions:\\n\\nYour use of NVIDIA Corporation’s GRID Software is subject to the terms and conditions of the NVIDIA GRID Cloud End User License Agreement.\\nYour use of NVIDIA Corporation’s Tesla Driver, CUDA Toolkit, cuDNN, NVENC, NVCUVID, NVM:, nvidia-smi, and NCCL Library Software, toolkits, and drivers is subject to the terms and conditions of the NVIDIA Cloud End User License Agreement and NVIDIA Third Party Materials Notices.\\nYour use of Red Hat, Inc.’s software is subject to the terms and conditions of the\\xa0Red Hat Cloud Software Subscription Agreement. Red Hat also disclaims any (i) warranties with respect to Red Hat, Inc. software; and (ii) liability for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, punitive or consequential, and any loss of profits, revenue, data or data use, arising from use of Red Hat, Inc. software.\\nYour use of SUSE LLC’s software is subject to the terms and conditions of the SUSE End User License Agreement and the SUSE Terms and Conditions.\\nYour use of Apple Inc.’s software is subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Apple Software License Agreement.\\nYour use of Qualcomm Technologies Inc.’s software is subject to the terms and conditions of Qualcomm’s Software Development Kit License Agreement.\\n\\n5.3. Unless you specify a termination date, your Spot Instance request will remain active until the earlier of the following: (1) seven days have passed, (2) we fulfill it, or (3) you cancel it. We may terminate, stop, or hibernate Spot Instances at any time and without any notice to you if the current price for the applicable Spot Instance (the “Spot Price”) equals or exceeds the price you specified you were willing to pay for the Spot Instance (“Your Maximum Price”). Spot Instances purchased for a fixed duration (“Spot Blocks”) will not be terminated because the Spot Price equals or exceeds Your Maximum Price (if specified), but will terminate at the conclusion of the fixed duration. Spot Instances and Spot Blocks may also be terminated for AWS capacity requirements. If a Spot Block is terminated due to AWS capacity requirements, you will not be charged for that Spot Block. Spot Instances may not be used with certain Services, features, and third-party software we specify, including IBM software packages or Microsoft SQL Server. You may not, directly, indirectly, alone, or in cooperation with any third party, attempt to control, influence, or manipulate the price for Spot Instances. You may not submit requests for Spot Instances through any third party (e.g., “proxy bidding”) or share information with any third party regarding Your Maximum Price specified in your Spot Instance Requests.\\n5.4. EC2 Reserved Instances and Dedicated Hosts.\\n5.4.1.\\xa0We may change Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instance and EC2 Dedicated Host Reservation pricing at any time, but price changes will not apply to previously designated Savings Plans, EC2 Reserved Instances or EC2 Dedicated Host Reservations, except as described in this Section 5.4. If Microsoft increases the license fees it charges for Windows, or if Red Hat increases the license fees it charges for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (“RHEL”), we may make a corresponding increase to the per-hour usage rate (or institute a corresponding per-hour usage rate) for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, Windows or RHEL. Any increase in (or institution of) the per-hour usage rate for Savings Plans for, or EC2 Reserved Instances with, Windows will be made between December 1 and January 31, and we will provide 30 days’ notice.

We will deduct from each payment any applicable fees and charges due to us related to Marketable EC2 Reserved Instances. We may withhold, deduct, or setoff any amounts payable by you to us or our affiliates against any Transaction Proceeds. Payments will be made only to an ACH-enabled bank account located in the United States that you register with us. If there is an error in the processing of any Transaction, you authorize us to initiate debit or credit entries to your designated bank account, to correct such error, provided that any such correction is made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we are unable to debit your designated bank account for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment instrument that you have on file with us or to deduct the debit and applicable fees from future Transaction Proceeds.\\n5.6.5.\\xa0Sellers are responsible for the calculation, validation, and payment of any and all sales, use, excise, import, export, value added, withholding, and other taxes and duties assessed, incurred, or required to be collected or paid (“Taxes”) for any reason in connection with any Transaction and with any Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. We are not responsible for determining whether any Taxes apply to any Transaction or remitting Taxes to any taxing authority with respect to any Transaction, or for reporting any information (including the payment of Taxes) with respect to any Transaction. Each Seller will indemnify us and our affiliates against any claim or demand for payment of any Taxes imposed in connection with any Transaction, and for any fines, penalties, or similar charges imposed as a result of the Seller’s failure to collect, remit, or report any Taxes in connection with any Transaction.\\n5.6.6. For each Seller, we will collect the necessary data and tax forms to enable compliance with applicable tax laws. For example, for U.S.-based Sellers, we will collect and retain Seller name and address, and may collect the tax identification number and other data as needed to comply with Form 1099K reporting requirements; for non-U.S.-based Sellers, we will collect and retain a Form W-8BEN tax form (which includes name, address, and a signature) as proof that you are exempt from Form 1099K reporting. For each Buyer, we will collect and retain the Buyer’s name and address. Buyers and Sellers will not know the name of the other party to the Transaction until the Transaction is completed. Upon completion of the Transaction, we will share the applicable Buyer’s city, state, and zip with the Seller so that the Seller can calculate the appropriate tax (if any) to remit to the appropriate government entity. We will share the Seller’s legal name on the Buyer’s invoice. Buyers and Sellers may not use information about the Transaction or about the other party gained in connection with a Transaction (“Transaction Information”) for any purpose that is not related to the Transaction. For example, you may not, directly or indirectly: (1) disclose any Transaction Information to any third party, except as necessary for you to perform your tax obligations or other obligations under these Service Terms and only if you ensure that every recipient uses the information only for that purpose and complies with these restrictions; (2) use any Transaction Information for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever; (3) use any Transaction Information in any way inconsistent with applicable law; (4) contact a party to influence them to make an alternative sale or purchase; or (5) target communications of any kind on the basis of the intended recipient being an RI Marketplace Buyer or Seller.\\n5.7.

We may change the Digital Training subscription service fee from time to time by notifying you of the change and effective date before it takes effect. You may reject the change by cancelling your subscription at no additional cost at any time before a subscription service fee change takes effect. From time to time we may also offer non-recurring subscriptions. The provisions in this section regarding automatic renewal are not applicable to those subscriptions. \\n            If all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your subscription service fees, your subscription will be cancelled unless you provide us with a new payment method. If you provide us with a new payment method that is successfully charged before your subscription is cancelled, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge. \\n          \\n\\n            \\xa0 \\n          \\n\\n67.5. Enterprise Skills Transformation \\n          \\n\\n            \\xa0 \\n          \\n\\n67.5.1. Access.

Subject to your prior approval, you will arrange for AWS to have reasonable access to your Customer Systems to the extent required to enable EST, and at no additional cost to AWS.

AWS IQ Experts (“Providers”) offer their services (“Provider Services”) as independent contractors, and are not employees of you or us. AWS is not a party to the agreement between you and any Providers for their Provider Services, is not responsible or liable for Provider Services, and does not guarantee the quality or accuracy of Provider Services. For avoidance of doubt, any certification that a Provider obtains from us only certifies that the Provider has passed a test intended to evaluate the Provider’s proficiency and understanding of a particular AWS Service or area of knowledge to which that certification relates, and is not a guarantee that the Provider Services will be performed at any particular level of quality, speed, or to your specific requirements. \\n           \\n\\n\\n            \\xa0 \\n          \\n\\n70.2. AWS charges service fees for transactions between you and Providers on the AWS IQ marketplace. AWS only collects these service fees if you and a Provider pay and receive payment through the AWS IQ marketplace. Therefore, for 24 months from the time you identify a Provider through AWS IQ, you agree to use AWS IQ as your exclusive method to pay for Provider Services. For avoidance of doubt, if you did not identify a Provider through use of AWS IQ, such as if you worked with a Provider prior to connecting with that Provider on AWS IQ, then this section does not apply. \\n           \\n\\n\\n            \\xa0 \\n          \\n\\n70.3. You acknowledge and agree that we may use information from AWS IQ listings, proposals, chat communications, and additional terms proposed or agreed to between you and Providers on AWS IQ to develop and improve the quality and feature set of AWS IQ.\\xa0 \\n           \\n\\n70.4. If you choose to grant Providers access to your AWS account, you are solely responsible and liable for (a) any actions taken by the Provider in your account; (b) the Provider’s use of Your Content or use of the Services or AWS Content; (c) ensuring the Provider complies with your obligations under the Agreement, the Acceptable Use Policy, any other Policies, the Intellectual Property License and applicable laws; (d) ensuring the Provider does not use the Services or AWS Content in any manner or for any purpose other than as expressly permitted by the Agreement and the Intellectual Property License; and (e) ensuring Provider does not attempt to (i) modify, distribute, alter, tamper with, repair, or otherwise create derivative works of any AWS Content or other Content included in the Services (except to the extent Content included in the Services is provided to you under a separate license that expressly permits the creation of derivative works), (ii) reverse engineer, disassemble, or decompile the Services or AWS Content or apply any other process or procedure to derive the source code of any software included in the Services or AWS Content (except to the extent applicable law doesn’t allow this restriction), (iii) access or use the Services in a way intended to avoid incurring fees or exceeding usage limits or quotas, or (iv) resell or sublicense the Services or AWS Content. You will immediately revoke Provider’s access to your AWS account if you become aware of any violation of your obligations under the Agreement or the Intellectual Property License caused by a Provider with access to your AWS account. If you use AWS IQ’s feature that allows you to grant a Provider access to your account, AWS may, but is not obligated to, review activities in your account for security purposes, and may revoke the Provider’s access at any time. \\n\\n70.5. You release us (and our agents and employees) from claims, demands, and damages (actual or consequential) of any and every kind and nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed and undisclosed, arising out of or in any way connected with your use of the AWS IQ marketplace. \\n           \\n\\n\\n 71.

See the AWS Turkey FAQs for\\xa0more information. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Last Updated: May 17, 2024\\n See What\\'s Changed\\n\\nThis AWS Customer Agreement (this “Agreement”) contains the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Services (as defined below) and is an agreement between the applicable AWS Contracting Party specified in Section 12 below (also referred to as “AWS,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and you or the entity you represent (“you” or “your”). This Agreement takes effect when you click an “I Accept” button or check box presented with these terms or, if earlier, when you use any of the Services (the “Effective Date”). You represent to us that you are lawfully able to enter into contracts (e.g., you are not a minor). If you are entering into this Agreement for an entity, such as the company you work for, you represent to us that you have legal authority to bind that entity. Please see Section 12 for definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement. \\n\\n 1. AWS Responsibilities\\n\\n1.1 General. You may access and use the Services in accordance with this Agreement. Service Level Agreements and Service Terms apply to certain Services.\\n1.2 Third-Party Content. Third-Party Content may be used by you at your election. Third-Party Content is governed by this Agreement and, if applicable, separate terms and conditions accompanying such Third-Party Content, which terms and conditions may include separate fees and charges.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n1.3\\xa0AWS Security. Without limiting Section 8 or your obligations under Section 2.2, we will implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help you secure Your Content against accidental or unlawful loss, access or disclosure.\\n1.4 Data Privacy.\\xa0You may specify the AWS regions in which Your Content will be stored. You consent to the storage of Your Content in, and transfer of Your Content into, the AWS regions you select. We will not access or use Your Content except as necessary to maintain or provide the Services, or as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. We will not (a) disclose Your Content to any government or third party or (b) move Your Content from the AWS regions selected by you; except in each case as necessary to comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body. Unless it would violate the law or a binding order of a governmental body, we will give you notice of any legal requirement or order referred to in this Section 1.4. We will only use your Account Information in accordance with the Privacy Notice, and you consent to such usage. The Privacy Notice does not apply to Your Content.\\n1.5 Notice of Changes to the Services. We may change or discontinue any of the Services from time to time. We will provide you at least 12 months’ prior notice before discontinuing a material functionality of a Service that\\xa0we make generally available to customers and that you are using. AWS will not be obligated to provide such notice under this Section 1.5 if the discontinuation is necessary to (a) address an emergency, or risk of harm to the Services or AWS, (b) respond to claims, litigation, or loss of license rights related to third party intellectual property rights, or (c) comply with law,\\xa0but should any of the preceding occur AWS will provide you with as much prior notice as is reasonably practicable under the circumstances.\\n1.6 Notice of Changes to the Service Level Agreements. We may change, discontinue or add Service Level Agreements, provided, however, that we will provide at least 90 days’ advance notice for adverse changes to any Service Level Agreement. \\n\\n 2.

To access the Services, you must have an AWS account associated with a valid email address and a valid form of payment. Unless\\xa0explicitly permitted by the Service Terms, you will only create one account per email address. Except to the extent caused by our breach of this Agreement, (a) you are responsible for all activities that occur under your account, regardless of whether the activities are authorized by you or undertaken by you, your employees or a third party (including your contractors, agents or End Users), and (b) we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to your account. \\n2.2 Your Content. You are responsible for Your Content. You will ensure that Your Content and your and End Users’ use of Your Content or the Services\\xa0will not violate any of the Policies or any applicable law.\\xa0\\n2.3 Your Security and Backup. You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Services and otherwise taking appropriate action to secure, protect and backup your accounts and Your Content in a manner that will provide appropriate security and protection, which might include use of encryption to protect Your Content from unauthorized access and routinely archiving Your Content. \\n2.4 Log-In Credentials and Account Keys.

If you become aware of any violation of your obligations under this Agreement caused by an End User, you will immediately suspend access to Your Content and the\\xa0Services by such End User. We do not provide any support or services to End Users unless we have a separate agreement with you or an End User obligating us to provide such support or services.\\xa0\\n\\n 3. Fees and Payment.\\n\\n3.1 Service Fees. We calculate and bill fees and charges monthly. We may bill you more frequently for fees accrued if we reasonably suspect that your account is fraudulent or at risk of non-payment. You will pay us the applicable fees and charges for use of the Services as described on the AWS Site using one of the payment methods we support. All amounts payable by you under this Agreement will be paid to us without setoff or counterclaim, and without any deduction or withholding. Fees and charges for any new Service or new feature of a Service will be effective when we post updated fees and charges on the AWS Site, unless we expressly state otherwise in a notice. We may increase or add new fees and charges for any existing Services you are using by giving you at least 30 days’ prior notice. We may elect to charge you interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the highest rate permitted by law, if less) on all late payments.\\xa0If we suspend your account under Section 4.1 or terminate your use of the Services pursuant to Section 5.2(b)(ii), we may elect not to bill you for fees and charges after suspension unless your account is reinstated.\\n3.2 Taxes.\\xa0\\n(a) Each party will be responsible, as required under applicable law, for identifying and paying all taxes and other governmental fees and charges (and any penalties, interest, and other additions thereto) that are imposed on that party upon or with respect to the transactions and payments under this Agreement. All fees payable by you are exclusive of Indirect Taxes, except where applicable law requires otherwise. We may charge and you will pay applicable Indirect Taxes that we are legally obligated or authorized to collect from you. You will provide such information to us as reasonably required to determine whether we are obligated to collect Indirect Taxes from you. We will not collect, and you will not pay, any Indirect Tax for which you furnish us a properly completed exemption certificate or a direct payment permit certificate for which we can claim an available exemption from such Indirect Tax. All payments made by you to us under this Agreement will be made free and clear of any deduction or withholding, as required by law. If any such deduction or withholding (including cross-border withholding taxes) is required on any payment, you will pay such additional amounts as are necessary so that the net amount received by us is equal to the amount then due and payable under this Agreement. We will provide you with such tax forms as are reasonably requested in order to reduce or eliminate the amount of any withholding or deduction for taxes in respect of payments made under this Agreement.\\xa0\\n(b)\\xa0If the applicable AWS Contracting Party is Amazon Web Services India Private Limited (\"AWS India\") (formerly known as Amazon Internet Services Private Limited), the parties agree that the provisions of this Section 3.2(b) will apply.\\nYou acknowledge that AWS India may display the applicable fees and charges for the Services on the Site in USD (or such other currency as AWS India may deem fit). However, AWS India will invoice you in INR calculated and converted in accordance with the conversion rate determined by us on the date of invoice (\"INR Equivalent Fees\"). You will only be liable to pay the INR Equivalent Fees indicated in each invoice.\\nWe will invoice you from our registered office at the address of your establishment (as registered with the tax authorities, if applicable) receiving the Services in accordance with the applicable indirect tax laws.\\nAll fees and charges payable under this Agreement will be exclusive of applicable national, state or local indirect taxes (\"Taxes\") that AWS India is legally obligated to charge under applicable law. For the purpose of this clause, local indirect taxes include Goods and Services Tax (“GST”), which includes the Central Goods and Services Tax (\"CGST\"), the State Goods and Services Tax (\"SGST\"), the Union Territory Goods and Services Tax (\"UGST\"), the Integrated Goods and Services Tax (\"IGST\") as may be applicable. The Taxes charged by AWS India will be stated in the invoice pursuant to applicable laws. AWS India may charge and you will pay any applicable Taxes, which are stated separately on the invoice. As per the statutory requirement under GST, you will provide all necessary information such as the correct GST registered address, legal name and GSTIN (\"GST Information\") in order for AWS India to issue correct GST invoices as per the applicable legal requirements. In the event, the GST invoice is incorrect, you will inform us in a timely manner, to enable AWS India to correct the GST tax invoice. AWS India will determine the place of supply for the Services based on the GST Information provided by you and accordingly, charge GST (CGST and SGST/UTGST or IGST) on its invoice. Any withholding taxes that may be applicable to the fees and charges payable to us are for our account. You will pay the fees and charges in our invoice in full (gross) without applying any withholding taxes. If you separately deposit applicable withholding taxes on such fees and charges to the applicable government treasury and issue us a withholding tax certificate evidencing such deposit, following receipt of the withholding tax certificate in original form, we will reimburse to you an amount equal to the taxes that are evidenced as deposited. \\n\\n 4. Temporary Suspension.\\n\\n4.1 Generally. We may suspend your or any End User’s right to access or use any portion or all of the Services immediately upon notice to you if we\\xa0reasonably determine:\\n(a) your or an End User’s use of the Services (i) poses a security risk to the\\xa0Services or any third party, (ii) could adversely impact our systems, the\\xa0Services or the systems or Content of any other AWS customer, (iii) could subject us, our affiliates, or any third party to liability, or (iv) could be fraudulent;\\n(b) you are, or any End User is, in material breach of this Agreement;\\n(c) you are in breach of your payment obligations under Section 3; or\\n(d) you have ceased to operate in the ordinary course, made an assignment for the benefit of creditors or similar disposition of your assets, or become the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation, dissolution or similar proceeding.\\n4.2 Effect of Suspension.

Universal Service Terms (Applicable to All Services)\\n\\nThe Service Terms below govern your use of the Services. Capitalized terms used in these Service Terms but not defined below are defined in the AWS Customer Agreement\\xa0or other agreement with us governing your use of the Services (the “Agreement”). For purposes of these Service Terms, “Your Content” includes any “Company Content” and any “Customer Content,” and “AWS Content” includes “Amazon Properties.”\\n\\n\\n1.1. You may not transfer outside the Services any software (including related documentation) you obtain from us or third party licensors in connection with the Services without specific authorization to do so.\\n1.2.\\xa0You must comply with current technical documentation applicable to the Services (including applicable user, admin, and developer guides) posted on the AWS Site at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html (and any successor or related locations designated by us).\\xa0\\n1.3. You will provide information or other materials related to Your Content (including copies of any client-side applications) as reasonably requested by us to verify your compliance with the Agreement. You will reasonably cooperate with us to identify the source of any problem with the Services that we reasonably believe may be attributable to Your Content or any end user materials that you control.\\n1.4. In connection with your use of the Services, you are responsible for maintaining licenses and adhering to the license terms of any software you run. If we reasonably believe any of Your Content violates the law, infringes or misappropriates the rights of any third party, or otherwise violates a material term of the Agreement (including the Service Terms, or the Acceptable Use Policy) (“Prohibited Content”), we will notify you of the Prohibited Content and may request that such content be removed from the Services or access to it be disabled. If you do not remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content within 2 business days of our notice, we may remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content or suspend the Services to the extent we are not able to remove or disable access to the Prohibited Content. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may remove or disable access to any Prohibited Content without prior notice in connection with illegal content, where the content may disrupt or threaten the Services or in accordance with applicable law or any judicial, regulatory or other governmental order or request. In the event that we remove Your Content without prior notice, we will provide prompt notice to you unless prohibited by law. We terminate the accounts of repeat infringers in appropriate circumstances.\\n1.5. You will ensure that all information you provide to us via the AWS Site (e.g., information provided in connection with your registration for the Services, requests for increased usage limits) is accurate, complete, and not misleading.\\n1.6. From time to time, we may apply upgrades, patches, bug fixes, or other maintenance to the Services and AWS Content (“Maintenance”). We agree to use reasonable efforts to provide you with prior notice of any scheduled Maintenance (except for emergency Maintenance), and you agree to use reasonable efforts to comply with any Maintenance requirements that we notify you about.\\n1.7. If your Agreement does not include a provision on AWS Confidential Information, and you and AWS do not have an effective non-disclosure agreement in place, then you agree that you will not disclose AWS Confidential Information (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement), except as required by law.\\n1.8. You may perform benchmarks or comparative tests or evaluations (each, a “Benchmark”) of the Services. If you perform or disclose, or direct or permit any third party to perform or disclose, any Benchmark of any of the Services, you (i) will include in any disclosure, and will disclose to us, all information necessary to replicate such Benchmark, and (ii) agree that we may perform and disclose the results of Benchmarks of your products or services, irrespective of any restrictions on Benchmarks in the terms governing your products or services.\\n1.9. Only the applicable AWS Contracting Party (as defined in the AWS Customer Agreement) will have obligations with respect to each AWS account, and no other AWS Contracting Party has any obligation with respect to such account. The AWS Contracting Party for an account may change as described in the Agreement, and the new AWS Contracting Party will be responsible for issuing any invoices to you after such change, including monthly invoices. Invoices for each account will reflect the AWS Contracting Party that is responsible for that account during the applicable billing period. You agree to accept invoices from AWS electronically, in a format and method of delivery as determined by AWS, e.g., in a PDF format, as permitted under applicable law.\\nIf, as of the time of a change of the AWS Contracting Party responsible for your account, you have made an up-front payment for any Services under such account, then the AWS Contracting Party you paid such up-front payment to may remain the AWS Contracting Party for the applicable account only with respect to the Services related to such up-front payment.\\n1.10. When you use a Service, you may be able to use or be required to use one or more other Services (each, an “Associated Service”), and when you use an Associated Service, you are subject to the terms and fees that apply to that Associated Service.\\n1.11. If you process the personal data of End Users or other identifiable individuals in your use of a Service, you are responsible for providing legally adequate privacy notices and obtaining necessary consents for the processing of such data. You represent to us that you have provided all necessary privacy notices and obtained all necessary consents. You are responsible for processing such data in accordance with applicable law.\\n1.12. If you have been charged for a Service for a period when that Service was unavailable (as defined in the applicable Service Level Agreement for each Service), you may request a Service credit equal to any charged amounts for such period.\\n1.13. If you are a customer that is subject to the French Politique générale de sécurité des systems d’information de santé (PGSSI-S), you agree that your use of the Services complies with the PGSSI-S.\\n1.14. Data Protection.\\n1.14.1 These Service Terms incorporate the AWS Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”), when you use AWS Services to process Customer Data (as defined in the DPA).\\xa0 \\n1.14.2 These Service Terms incorporate the AWS Supplementary Addendum to the DPA, when you use AWS Services to process Customer Data (as defined in the DPA). \\n1.14.3 These Service Terms incorporate the Standard Contractual Clauses between controllers and processors (“Controller-to-Processor Clauses”) and the Standard Contractual Clauses between processors (“Processor-to-Processor Clauses”) approved by the European Commission Implementing Decision (EU) 2021/914 of 4 June 2021 (the “SCCs”). The SCCs will only apply when: (i) the GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Customer Data; and (ii) Customer Data is transferred either directly or via onward transfer, to a country outside of the European Economic Area not recognised by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data subject to GDPR (together a “Data Transfer”). When you are a controller (as defined in the GDPR), the Controller-to-Processor Clauses will apply to a Data Transfer. When you are a processor (as defined in the GDPR), the Processor-to-Processor Clauses will apply to a Data Transfer.\\n1.14.4 These Service Terms incorporate the AWS UK GDPR Addendum to the DPA, when the UK GDPR applies to your use of the AWS Services to process UK Customer Data (as defined in the AWS UK GDPR Addendum),\\xa0and the AWS Swiss Addendum to the DPA, when the FDPA applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Swiss Customer Data (as defined in the AWS Swiss Addendum). \\n1.14.5\\xa0These Service Terms incorporate the AWS CCPA Terms (“CCPA Terms”), when the CCPA applies to your use of the AWS Services to process Personal Information (as defined in the CCPA Terms).\\n1.15.\\xa0Following closure of your AWS account, we will delete Your Content in accordance with the technical documentation applicable to the Services.\\n1.16. Your receipt and use of any Promotional Credits is subject to the AWS Promotional Credit Terms & Conditions.\\n1.17. Payment Currency\\n1.17.1 AWS provides a Service that enables payment in certain currencies (“Payment Currency”) other than United States dollars when you purchase certain Services from AWS (the “Currency Service”). When you purchase Services in certain countries outside of the United States, we may require you, because of currency controls or other factors, to use the Currency Service. When using the Currency Service you are not tendering payment in one currency and receiving from us another currency.\\n1.17.2 When you use the Currency Service, Service fees and charges will automatically be invoiced in the Payment Currency. You must pay invoices in the currency specified on each invoice, but, for credit card or debit card purchases, you may only make payments in currencies supported by the issuer of your card. If the issuer of your credit card or debit card does not support the required Payment Currency, you must use a different payment method that does support paying in the Payment Currency.\\n1.17.3 Our fees and charges for your use of the Currency Service, if any, are included in the exchange rate applied to your invoice (the “Applicable Exchange Rate”). Third-parties, such as your bank, credit card issuer, debit card issuer, or card network, may charge you additional fees. The Applicable Exchange Rate is determined at the time your invoice is generated and, for invoices covering usage of Services over a period of time, will apply to all usage and Service charges listed on that invoice.\\n1.17.4 All refunds processed against an invoice will be provided in the currency in which the invoice was generated and reflected as a credit memo or a payment in your Payment Currency.\\n1.17.5 You agree that by using the Currency Service, information related to your payment, including your name and address, may be used by our banking partners to process your payments in jurisdictions other than the United States.\\n1.18.\\xa0By accessing and using AWS Content or the Services, you agree to the terms of the Intellectual Property License.\\n1.19. We will not use Individualized Usage Data or Your Content to compete with your products and services. “Individualized Usage Data” means data about your use of the Services that are specifically identified with your AWS account. \\n1.20. We may use information about how you use and interact with the Services to improve those Services. \\n1.21. Information included in resource identifiers, metadata tags, access controls, rules, usage policies, permissions, and similar items related to the management of AWS resources does not constitute Your Content. AWS recommends that you do not include personally identifying, confidential, or sensitive information in these items. \\n1.22. Tax Exempt Status\\xa0\\n1.22.1 To request tax exempt status for your AWS account, you must provide us with a valid tax exemption certificate or other equivalent documentation for the relevant jurisdiction.\\xa0 You are responsible for updating such documentation so it is accurate at all times. \\n1.22.2 In certain jurisdictions (as noted in the AWS Tax Help pages), you may only use your tax-exempt account to purchase services that are eligible for tax exemption. If you do not use services for the purpose for which your tax exemption applies, you are responsible for reporting and paying sales and use taxes for that usage directly to the relevant tax authorities to the extent required by law.\\xa0\\n1.22.3 If you are required by law to pay us using your organization’s funds to qualify for your tax exemption, you warrant that purchases on your account will be made with the tax-exempt organization’s funds.\\xa0\\n1.22.4\\xa0We may, in our sole discretion, reject your request for tax exempt status or revoke the tax exempt status of your account at any time.\\n1.22.5 If you turn on tax settings inheritance, you warrant that the application of any tax exemption on your Management Account to your Organization’s Member Accounts (both as defined in the AWS Organizations section below) complies with applicable tax laws. If a governmental authority determines that the correct amount of tax has not been collected on your purchases, you will promptly reimburse AWS for any associated costs.\\n1.23. If you use any artificial intelligence and machine learning Services, features, and functionality (including third-party models) that we provide, you will comply with the AWS Responsible AI Policy.\\n1.24. Certain Services may incorporate generative AI features, powered by Amazon Bedrock, that enable you to use prompts to generate output, including: Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon CodeCatalyst, Amazon Connect Contact Lens, Amazon DataZone, Amazon Lex, Amazon Personalize, Amazon Q, AWS AppFabric, AWS HealthScribe, and AWS App Studio.\\xa0The Amazon Bedrock automated abuse detection mechanisms may apply to such services. See here for more details.\\n1.25. You will not use, and will not facilitate or allow End Users to use, the Services to mine cryptocurrency without our prior written approval.\\n1.26. AWS consents to the assignment of an AWS account from one entity to another, subject to the terms of the AWS Account Assignment Requirements, posted here.\\n1.27. To benefit from any contract with AWS enabling you to use AWS Services under the same terms as your affiliate\\'s Agreement solely because your accounts are joined as Member Accounts of their Organization (as defined in the AWS Organizations section below), your AWS Contracting Party must be a signatory to your affiliate\\'s Agreement.\\n\\n 2. Betas and Previews\\n\\n2.1. This Section describes the additional terms and conditions under which you may (a) access and use certain features, technologies, and services made available to you by AWS that are not yet generally available, including, but not limited to, any products, services, or features labeled “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental”, and any related AWS Content (each, a “Beta Service”) or (b) access and use Services and any related AWS Content available in AWS regions that are not generally available, including, but not limited to, any AWS regions identified by AWS as “beta”, “preview”, “pre-release”, or “experimental” (each, a “Beta Region”).\\n2.2. You must comply with all terms related to any Beta Service or Beta Region as posted on the AWS Site or otherwise made available to you. AWS may add or modify terms, including lowering or raising any usage limits, related to access to or use of any Beta Services or Beta Regions at any time. AWS may add, modify, or remove functionality, features, documentation, or other related aspects of any Beta Service or Beta Region at any time and these aspects may be different from any generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region. Service Level Agreements do not apply to Beta Services or Beta Regions.\\n2.3. You may provide AWS with information relating to your access, use, testing, or evaluation of Beta Services or Beta Regions, including observations or information regarding the performance, features, and functionality of Beta Services or Beta Regions (“Test Observations”). AWS will own and may use and evaluate all Test Observations for its own purposes. You will not use any Test Observations except for your internal evaluation purposes of any Beta Service or Beta Region.\\n2.4.\\xa0AWS may suspend or terminate your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region at any time. Your access to and use of each Beta Service and Beta Region will automatically terminate upon the release of a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region or upon notice of termination by AWS. Unless otherwise communicated to You, any Beta Service or Beta Region made available to You is provided for evaluation purposes and should not be used for processing sensitive data. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, after suspension or termination of your access to or use of any Beta Service or Beta Region for any reason, (a) you will not have any further right to access or use the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region, and (b) Your Content used in the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region may be deleted or inaccessible and Your Content may not be migrated over to a generally available version of the applicable Beta Service or Beta Region.\\n2.5. Test Observations, Suggestions concerning a Beta Service or Beta Region, and any other information about or involving (including the existence of) any Beta Service or Beta Region are considered AWS Confidential Information.\\n2.6.\\xa0WITHOUT LIMITING ANY DISCLAIMERS IN THE AGREEMENT OR THE SERVICE TERMS, BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS ARE NOT READY FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL RELEASE AND MAY CONTAIN BUGS, ERRORS, DEFECTS, OR HARMFUL COMPONENTS. ACCORDINGLY, AND NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN THE AGREEMENT OR THESE SERVICES TERMS, AWS IS PROVIDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS TO YOU “AS IS.” AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS MAKE NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE REGARDING BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY THAT THE BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BECOME GENERALLY AVAILABLE, BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR FREE, OR FREE OF HARMFUL COMPONENTS, OR THAT ANY CONTENT, INCLUDING YOUR CONTENT, WILL BE SECURE OR NOT OTHERWISE LOST OR DAMAGED. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY LAW, AWS AND ITS AFFILIATES AND LICENSORS DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF ANY COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. AWS’S AND ITS AFFILIATES’ AND LICENSORS’ AGGREGATE LIABILITY FOR ANY BETA SERVICES AND BETA REGIONS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT YOU ACTUALLY PAY US UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FOR THE BETA SERVICES OR BETA REGIONS THAT GAVE RISE TO THE CLAIM DURING THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM. \\n\\n 3. Amazon CloudFront\\n\\nYou must own or have all necessary rights to use any domain name or SSL certificate that you use in conjunction with Amazon CloudFront. You are solely responsible for the renewal, security, and proper configuration of any SSL certificates that you provide for use with Amazon CloudFront, including any disclosure of your SSL certificates to third parties. \\n\\n 4. AWS Outposts\\n\\n4.1.\\xa0“AWS Outposts” includes AWS Outposts racks and AWS Outposts servers. \\n4.2. Outposts Equipment. AWS will make equipment available to you to support your use of the AWS Outposts Service (the “Outposts Equipment”). AWS or its affiliates maintain all rights in the Outposts Equipment and is not selling, renting, leasing, or transferring any ownership, intellectual or other rights in the Outposts Equipment to you. You will not, and will not purport to, assign, grant, or transfer the Outposts Equipment or any interest in the Outposts Equipment to any individual or entity, and any such purported assignment, grant or transfer is void. \\n4.3. Facility Assessment. You will ensure that, at all times, the facility at which the Outposts Equipment is located (the “Designated Facility”) meets the minimum requirements necessary to support the installation, maintenance, use, and removal of the Outposts Equipment as described here and otherwise as described\\xa0in the Outposts technical documentation or indicated to you during the ordering and installation process.\\n4.4. Delivery and Use. You will ensure that you have all necessary rights, certifications, and licenses for the delivery, installation, maintenance, use, and removal of the Outposts Equipment at the Designated Facility. You are responsible for any damage to the Outposts Equipment while it is at the Designated Facility, unless caused by AWS. AWS may terminate your use of AWS Outposts and remove the Outposts Equipment if you breach these terms or materially breach the terms of the Agreement with respect to AWS Outposts. In the event that we terminate your use of AWS Outposts and remove the Outposts Equipment in accordance with this Section 4.4, we will provide you with prior notice where practicable under the circumstances. \\xa0\\n4.5. Access to Outposts Equipment. You will give personnel designated by AWS prompt and reasonable access to the Designated Facility as necessary to deliver, install, inspect, maintain, and remove the Outposts Equipment. You will not require AWS personnel to sign, accept, or otherwise agree to any documentation as a condition of accessing the Designated Facility, and you agree that the terms of any such documentation are void even if signed by AWS personnel. You will ensure that no one accesses, moves, or repairs the Outposts Equipment other than (i) personnel designated by AWS, (ii) as permitted in writing by AWS in connection with the maintenance of Outposts Equipment, or (iii) as necessary due to a situation involving imminent injury, damage to property, or an active fire alarm system. You will ensure that no one modifies, alters, reverse engineers, or tampers with the Outposts Equipment. You acknowledge that the Outposts Equipment may be equipped with tamper monitoring.\\n4.6. AWS Support Options. You will remain enrolled in either Enterprise On-Ramp Support or Enterprise Support during the entire period of your use of AWS Outposts.\\n4.7. Services/SLAs/Security. The Service Terms for any Services that run locally on AWS Outposts also apply to your use of those Services on AWS Outposts. There are inherent differences between Services running locally on AWS Outposts from those Services running at AWS operated facilities because the Outposts Equipment is physically located at the Designated Facility where you are responsible for physical security and access controls, as well as all power, networking, and environmental conditions. Due to these differences:\\na. The Service Level Agreements for any Services that run locally on AWS Outposts do not apply to your use of those Services on AWS Outposts.\\nb. Any AWS commitments in the Agreement that depend on AWS’s operation of such physical security and access controls, or power, networking, and environmental conditions, do not apply to AWS Outposts or any Services running locally on AWS Outposts.\\nc.\\xa0The specific compliance and assurance programs for which AWS Outposts are in scope are listed here. For other Services listed here, those Services are not in scope when running locally on AWS Outposts unless AWS Outposts is also separately listed for the specific compliance or assurance program.\\n4.8. AWS Outposts servers \\n4.8.1.\\xa0Installation, Use, and Removal.

We may impose transaction limits on some or all Buyers and Sellers relating to the value of any Transaction or disbursement, the cumulative value of all Transactions or disbursements during a period of time, or the number of Transactions that we will process over a period of time. We may withhold for investigation, or refuse to process, any Transaction that we suspect is fraudulent, unlawful, or otherwise violates these Service Terms, the Agreement, or the Acceptable Use Policy. For each Transaction, we will not remit Transaction Proceeds to a Seller, and the Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance will not be available to the Buyer, until after we have successfully processed payments for that Transaction from the Buyer.\\n5.6.4. You will not receive any funds collected from payments associated with the hourly prices of your Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. At the end of each business day, we will pay to you all due and payable Transaction Proceeds that we have collected as of the date that is 2 business days prior to that date. We will deduct from each payment any applicable fees and charges due to us related to Marketable EC2 Reserved Instances. We may withhold, deduct, or setoff any amounts payable by you to us or our affiliates against any Transaction Proceeds. Payments will be made only to an ACH-enabled bank account located in the United States that you register with us. If there is an error in the processing of any Transaction, you authorize us to initiate debit or credit entries to your designated bank account, to correct such error, provided that any such correction is made in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we are unable to debit your designated bank account for any reason, you authorize us to resubmit the debit, plus any applicable fees, to any other bank account or payment instrument that you have on file with us or to deduct the debit and applicable fees from future Transaction Proceeds.\\n5.6.5.\\xa0Sellers are responsible for the calculation, validation, and payment of any and all sales, use, excise, import, export, value added, withholding, and other taxes and duties assessed, incurred, or required to be collected or paid (“Taxes”) for any reason in connection with any Transaction and with any Marketable EC2 Reserved Instance. We are not responsible for determining whether any Taxes apply to any Transaction or remitting Taxes to any taxing authority with respect to any Transaction, or for reporting any information (including the payment of Taxes) with respect to any Transaction. Each Seller will indemnify us and our affiliates against any claim or demand for payment of any Taxes imposed in connection with any Transaction, and for any fines, penalties, or similar charges imposed as a result of the Seller’s failure to collect, remit, or report any Taxes in connection with any Transaction.\\n5.6.6. For each Seller, we will collect the necessary data and tax forms to enable compliance with applicable tax laws. For example, for U.S.-based Sellers, we will collect and retain Seller name and address, and may collect the tax identification number and other data as needed to comply with Form 1099K reporting requirements; for non-U.S.-based Sellers, we will collect and retain a Form W-8BEN tax form (which includes name, address, and a signature) as proof that you are exempt from Form 1099K reporting. For each Buyer, we will collect and retain the Buyer’s name and address. Buyers and Sellers will not know the name of the other party to the Transaction until the Transaction is completed. Upon completion of the Transaction, we will share the applicable Buyer’s city, state, and zip with the Seller so that the Seller can calculate the appropriate tax (if any) to remit to the appropriate government entity. We will share the Seller’s legal name on the Buyer’s invoice. Buyers and Sellers may not use information about the Transaction or about the other party gained in connection with a Transaction (“Transaction Information”) for any purpose that is not related to the Transaction. For example, you may not, directly or indirectly: (1) disclose any Transaction Information to any third party, except as necessary for you to perform your tax obligations or other obligations under these Service Terms and only if you ensure that every recipient uses the information only for that purpose and complies with these restrictions; (2) use any Transaction Information for any marketing or promotional purposes whatsoever; (3) use any Transaction Information in any way inconsistent with applicable law; (4) contact a party to influence them to make an alternative sale or purchase; or (5) target communications of any kind on the basis of the intended recipient being an RI Marketplace Buyer or Seller.\\n5.7.

Given the nature of machine learning systems, the following terms apply when Law Enforcement Agencies use Amazon Rekognition’s face comparison feature in connection with criminal investigations. “Law Enforcement Agency” means a government entity whose primary purpose and responsibilities are criminal investigation, apprehension and prosecution.\\n50.8.1. If Amazon Rekognition is used to assist in identifying a person, and actions will be taken based on the identification that could impact that person’s civil liberties or equivalent human rights, the decision to take action must be made by an appropriately trained person based on their independent examination of the identification evidence.\\n50.8.2. Law Enforcement Agencies that use Amazon Rekognition to assist personnel in making decisions that could impact civil liberties or equivalent human rights must ensure such personnel receive appropriate training on responsible use of facial recognition systems, including how to properly operate the system and interpret its results. For an example of how to implement such training, see the Facial Recognition Policy Development Template\\xa0published by the U.S Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance.\\n50.8.3. Amazon Rekognition may not be used for sustained surveillance of a specific person without following an independent review process that is designed to protect civil liberties or equivalent human rights (such as obtaining a court order, warrant, or other authorization), unless the use is to address exigent circumstances involving a threat of death or serious harm to a person.\\n50.8.4. Law Enforcement Agencies that use Amazon Rekognition for criminal investigations must provide a public disclosure describing their use of facial recognition systems. The method and content of the disclosure is at the reasonable discretion of the agency, but should be easily accessible to the public (such as a posting on a website), describe how the facial recognition system is used, and summarize safeguards in place to prevent violations of civil liberties or equivalent human rights. For examples, see statements and privacy assessments from the FBI and the Facial Recognition Policy Development Template published by the U.S Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Assistance.\\n50.9. Amazon Rekognition. The following terms also apply to Amazon Rekognition:\\n50.9.1. Amazon has implemented a moratorium on use of Amazon Rekognition’s face comparison feature by police departments in connection with criminal investigations. This moratorium does not apply to use of Amazon Rekognition’s face comparison feature to help identify or locate missing persons.\\n50.9.2. You agree that if you use Amazon Rekognition’s face APIs to analyze, detect, or process faces in images or videos, then you instruct AWS, as your processor, to: (1) generate face vectors and extract other facial attributes on your behalf; (2) store your face vectors in a secure AWS environment; (3) store, delete, and search your face vectors only at your direction or as necessary to maintain or provide Amazon Rekognition or comply with the law or a binding order of a governmental body; and (4) not use your face vectors for any other purpose (unless you instruct otherwise in writing) or transfer them to any third party. As the owner and controller of your face vectors, you instruct us to store them solely within AWS’s secure environment.\\n50.9.3.

We may change the Digital Training subscription service fee from time to time by notifying you of the change and effective date before it takes effect. You may reject the change by cancelling your subscription at no additional cost at any time before a subscription service fee change takes effect. From time to time we may also offer non-recurring subscriptions. The provisions in this section regarding automatic renewal are not applicable to those subscriptions. \\n            If all payment methods we have on file for you are declined for payment of your subscription service fees, your subscription will be cancelled unless you provide us with a new payment method. If you provide us with a new payment method that is successfully charged before your subscription is cancelled, your new subscription period will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge. \\n          \\n\\n            \\xa0 \\n          \\n\\n67.5. Enterprise Skills Transformation \\n          \\n\\n            \\xa0 \\n          \\n\\n67.5.1. Access. To enable EST support and guidance, AWS may require access to your internal communication systems including but not limited to email, instant messaging, and other systems related to such access as identified by you (“Customer Systems”).

Subject to your prior approval, you will arrange for AWS to have reasonable access to your Customer Systems to the extent required to enable EST, and at no additional cost to AWS.

AWS IQ Experts (“Providers”) offer their services (“Provider Services”) as independent contractors, and are not employees of you or us. AWS is not a party to the agreement between you and any Providers for their Provider Services, is not responsible or liable for Provider Services, and does not guarantee the quality or accuracy of Provider Services. For avoidance of doubt, any certification that a Provider obtains from us only certifies that the Provider has passed a test intended to evaluate the Provider’s proficiency and understanding of a particular AWS Service or area of knowledge to which that certification relates, and is not a guarantee that the Provider Services will be performed at any particular level of quality, speed, or to your specific requirements. \\n           \\n\\n\\n            \\xa0 \\n          \\n\\n70.2. AWS charges service fees for transactions between you and Providers on the AWS IQ marketplace. AWS only collects these service fees if you and a Provider pay and receive payment through the AWS IQ marketplace.

This means, for example, that your activities within the Third-Party Space may incur fees for which that Third-Party Space owner is responsible. Additionally, Content you contribute to a Third-Party Space or Project within that Space (“Contributed Content”) as an End User is not considered Your Content for the purposes of rights and obligations under the terms of this Agreement. Subject to the non-exclusive license granted by Section 93.2, this does not modify any rights you may hold in your Contributed Content.\\n93.2. Contributed Content, including issues, comments, and contributions to a Third-Party Space, may be viewed by others who have access to that Third-Party Space. Unless you enter into a license with other parties who have access to the Third-Party Space specifying different terms, you grant each party who has access to the Third-Party Space a nonexclusive, worldwide, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, prepare derivatives, distribute, perform, and display Contributed Content. You represent and warrant that you have all rights necessary to grant this license.\\n93.3.\\xa0When you invite another CodeCatalyst account owner to collaborate in your Space, they become an End User of your CodeCatalyst account and their Contributed Content is considered Your Content under the terms of the Agreement.

You are responsible for all fees you and End Users may accrue for using CodeCatalyst or any affiliated Service in connection with your Space.\\n93.4.\\xa0Unless you delegate administrative permissions over your CodeCatalyst Space to another CodeCatalyst account owner, you agree that termination of your CodeCatalyst account or deletion of any of Your Content or Contributed Content in your Space, whether by you or by us, may also terminate your End Users’ access to Your Content and Contributed Content in your Space. In order to access billable services within or in connection with your CodeCatalyst account, you must link an AWS account. If you delete your CodeCatalyst account but have delegated administrative permissions to another CodeCatalyst account owner, your AWS account will continue to be billed for the billable services unless you also un-link your AWS account.\\n93.5. When an End User you have invited to collaborate in your CodeCatalyst Space deletes their CodeCatalyst account, their Contributed Content will not be deleted from your Space.

Further, you understand and agree that to the extent any Privacy Rights Requests relate to Palm Data, after you have verified the identity of the requestor: (a) if the request is a deletion request, you will notify AWS of the request, and AWS will permanently destroy the Palm Data in accordance with applicable law; or (b) if the request is an access or portability request, you will inform the requestor with sufficient particularity that you have collected Palm Data, but you understand and agree that you will not be able to disclose or provide access to Palm Data because it is sensitive personal information and applicable privacy laws prohibit you from disclosing or providing access to such sensitive personal information in response to a Privacy Rights Request. Moreover, you understand and agree that you do not and will not have access to Palm Data because it constitutes both sensitive personal information and AWS’s trade secret.\\n101.7.
